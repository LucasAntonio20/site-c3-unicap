abstract: The current paper aims to present an integrative literature review of scientific articles published in national and international journals, approaching the use of information and communication technology (ICT) such as computers, tablets, iPad’s, mobile phones, e-readers, virtual reality and virtual learning environments, applied to dyslexia. The database consists of scientific articles published between 2010 and 2015, from the following platforms:Science Direct/Elsevier, SciELO - Scientific Electronic Library Online, MedLine - Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval and Portal de Periódicos da CAPES. Scientific articles were selected, corresponding to 20 international (95.23%) papers and 1 national (4.77%) paper. The works considered in the present paper in general aim at the development and application of technological instruments that can minimize the difficulties by dyslexics in reading and writing learning. Due to shortage of articles published in Brazil, there is a need for more studies on this topic in view of the benefits of ICT within evaluation and intervention in dyslexia observed in international articles.
